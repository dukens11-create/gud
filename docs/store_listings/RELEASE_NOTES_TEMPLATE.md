## Writing Tips

### Do's ✅

1. **Start with the most important changes**
   - New features first
   - Then improvements
   - Then bug fixes

2. **Use simple, clear language**
   - "Track your earnings" not "Implemented earnings calculation module"
   - "Faster app startup" not "Optimized initialization sequence"

3. **Be specific when helpful**
   - "30% faster" not "Much faster"
   - "Fixed crash on Android 14" not "Fixed crashes"

4. **Group similar items**
   - All GPS features together
   - All performance improvements together

5. **Express appreciation**
   - Thank users for feedback
   - Acknowledge bug reports
   - Show you're listening

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't use technical jargon**
   - Avoid: "Refactored authentication module"
   - Instead: "Improved login reliability"

2. **Don't be vague**
   - Avoid: "Various improvements"
   - Instead: "Faster search, better offline sync, smoother animations"

3. **Don't write novels**
   - Keep it concise
   - Users won't read walls of text
   - Bullet points > paragraphs

4. **Don't oversell minor changes**
   - Be honest about scope
   - Minor fixes are okay to group

5. **Don't ignore negative changes**
   - If removing a feature, explain why
   - If there's a known issue, acknowledge it
