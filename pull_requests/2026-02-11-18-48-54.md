## Problem Fixed 🔧

The "In Transit" filter was causing Firestore index errors because:
- App code uses 'in_transit' (underscore) ✅
- But some database records might have 'in-transit' (hyphen) ❌

## Solution 

This PR adds a migration script to fix the database status values.

## What's Included

### 📄 New Files

1. **`scripts/fix_status_values.dart`**
   - Migration script to update status values
   - Finds all loads with 'in-transit' 
   - Updates them to 'in_transit'
   - Shows progress and reports results

2. **`scripts/README.md`**
   - Complete documentation
   - How to run the script
   - What to expect
   - Safety information

## How to Use

```bash
# Run the migration script
dart run scripts/fix_status_values.dart
```

## What Happens

The script will:
1. ✅ Find all loads with status 'in-transit'
2. ✅ Update them to 'in_transit'  
3. ✅ Show progress for each load
4. ✅ Report total success/failure count

## After Running

- The "In Transit" filter will work correctly
- No more Firestore index errors
- No app code changes needed

## Notes

- **Safe to run multiple times** - won't affect already-fixed data
- **Only updates status field** - doesn't touch other data  
- **Shows detailed progress** - you can see exactly what's being updated

## Testing

After running the migration:
1. Open the driver dashboard
2. Click "In Transit" filter
3. Should show filtered loads without error ✅

**This is a database migration only** - the app code is already correct!
