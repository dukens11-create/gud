# iOS Configuration

## Firebase Setup

To complete the iOS Firebase setup:

1. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your Firebase project console
2. Place it in the `ios/Runner/` directory
3. The file should be at: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd ios
pod install

# Build the app
cd ..
flutter build ios
```

## Configuration Details

- **Bundle ID**: com.gudexpress.gud_app (matches Android package name)
- **Display Name**: GUD Express
- **iOS Deployment Target**: 12.0
- **Swift Version**: 5.0

## Required Files

The following files need to be generated by Flutter during build:
- `Flutter/Generated.xcconfig` - Generated by `flutter pub get`
- `Runner/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h/m` - Auto-generated plugin registrant

These files are excluded from git and will be created automatically when you run `flutter pub get` and `flutter build ios`.
