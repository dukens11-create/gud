# Appfile for GUD Express iOS App
# This file contains configuration for App Store Connect and Apple Developer Portal

# Your Apple ID / App Store Connect email
# Set this via environment variable: APPLE_ID
apple_id ENV["APPLE_ID"] || "your-apple-id@example.com"

# iTunes Connect Team ID (if you're part of multiple teams)
# Find this in App Store Connect > Users and Access > Team ID
itc_team_id ENV["ITC_TEAM_ID"] || "YOUR_ITC_TEAM_ID"

# Developer Portal Team ID (if different from iTunes Connect)
# Find this in Apple Developer Console > Membership
team_id ENV["TEAM_ID"] || "YOUR_TEAM_ID"

# Bundle identifier for your app
# This should match the bundle ID in your Xcode project
app_identifier "com.gudexpress.gud_app"

# Alternative: Use App Store Connect API Key (recommended)
# This avoids the need for Apple ID credentials and 2FA
# Set these environment variables:
# - APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID
# - APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID
# - APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH (path to .p8 file)
